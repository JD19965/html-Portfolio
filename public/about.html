        <h1>About Me</h1>

<p>"The best way to predict the future is to create it." </p>

<p>Hey there! 👋 Im a curious coder who started my journey crafting mobile apps — turning coffee ☕ into sleek Android builds and pixel-perfect UI screens. But lately, Ive been exploring a new playground — <strong>Web Development</strong> 🌐. Because why not bring those creative app vibes to the open web, right?</p>

<p>I love experimenting with clean designs, smart functionality, and smooth user experiences. Whether its debugging at 2 AM or that moment when the code finally runs (🎉), its all part of the fun!</p>

<p>"First, solve the problem. Then, write the code." </p>

<p>Now, Im stepping into the world of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — learning, building, and sometimes breaking things (on purpose 😅). Its just the beginning of my web dev story, but Im all in for the ride!</p>

<p>Stay tuned — this is just level one. 🚀</p>
